# Hi and wellcome!

I‚Äôm **Vincenzo Argese**, and my passion for computers and programming began back in **1989**, when my parents gave me a **Commodore 64**. With that little machine and its **BASIC programming manual**, I wrote my very first lines of code.  

In **2011**, I started my own **IT consulting business**, focusing on **cybersecurity** and **software development**.  

Since **2012**, I have specialized in **Digital Forensics** and **Incident Response** (**DFIR**) and serve as a **Technical Consultant (CTU)** for the Judiciary in criminal justice cases.  

The operating system I love and use the most is **Debian GNU/Linux**. Since 1999/2000,over 25 years now, it has been the foundation of all my activities: daily work, personal projects, software development, game development, system administration, and digital forensics.  

My favorite programming languages are **C** and **Python**. In my free time, I enjoy developing **video games** with **Godot Engine (GDScript)** and **Unreal Engine (C++)**. My philosophy is to write code that is **clean**, **functional**, and **secure**: no unnecessary complexity, just efficiency and elegance.  

Since **2019**, I have been collaborating with **Microtech srl**, a company specializing in IT consulting for the **education sector**. I provide **cybersecurity training** for teachers and administrative staff in schools, and I also work on web development projects.  

This website is my personal space, where I share the things I love: projects, experiments, and ideas.

# Why Crisium?
The name "Crisium" (or "cr1s1um") comes from a character I used to play in an old text-based role-playing game from the '80s/'90s, accessed via telnet (MUD - Tempora Sanguinis): a blood-sucking vampire anti-paladin in a dark and fascinating fantasy world.
