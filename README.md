Hi! I'm **Vincenzo Argese** and my passion for computing began in **1989**, when my parents gave me a **Commodore 64**. That little machine, and its **BASIC programming manual**, was where I typed my very first lines of code.

In **2011**, I started my own **IT consultancy business**, focusing on **cybersecurity** and **software development**. Since **2012**, I’ve worked as a **technical expert (CTU)** specializing in **Digital Forensics**, **incident response** (**DFIR**).

I regularly use **C**, **C++**, **Python**, **PHP**, **HTML5/CSS/JavaScript**, and frameworks like **React** in my professional projects. For fun, I develop **videogames** with **Unity3D (C#)** and **Godot Engine (GDScript)**.

I also have experience teaching **cybersecurity and privacy** in schools, especially through training projects with **Microtech srl**.

I'm passionate about writing code that is **clean**, **functional**, and **secure** — no fluff, just efficiency and elegance.

This website is a place where I share what I love: projects, experiments, and ideas. 

Welcome to my digital world!
